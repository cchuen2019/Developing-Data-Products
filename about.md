## Oregon State Employee Salary Data Explorer  

This Shiny App is for searching and visulizating Oregon State Employee Salary information from year 2012 to 2014. The total number of set records is 109493 and that of service types records is 12.  
The dataset is from [Oregon.gov](http://www.oregon.gov/transparency/pages/state_workforce.aspx) that contains the basic information of each set (AGENCY #','AGENCY TITLE','CLASSIFICATION','SERVICE TYPE','FULL/PART TIME','ANNUAL SALARY','FISCAL YEAR').    


### Data Description 
Each annual salary listed in this report is 12 times that particular employee's monthly adjusted salary rate as of June 30, 2014. "Annual Salary" includes most differential payments (such as work-out-of-classification and bilingual differential), but excludes payments for overtime, shift differential, benefits, and vacation payout. The report does not account for unpaid furlough leave that management employees began taking in fiscal year 2010-2011; neither does it reflect step decreases and unpaid furlough leave that some classified employees began taking after June 2009.

**Note**: Since I didn't use the API to collect data, the current data might not be 100% accurate.
Also, as the data size is quite huge (>100,000) , only a subset is used for this demo (10,000 samples randomly selected) and it takes a while for the plots to appear, so please be patient, Thank you!! :)
